<h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p> HeartStrawng by Healthy Bois. Water is an essential part of life as we know it, without it life would be dry. Here at HealthyBois we understand that remembering to drink
  enough water each day can be difficult that's why we developed HeartStrawng. Heart Stawng is a combination of an adaptable drinking straw and bracelet heart rate monitor to 
  track your water intake and heart health when connected to the HealthyBois app. Our app allows you to set goals, see results and feel the sense of accomplishment as you achieve 
  them.  The app helps visualize your water intake and heart rate over time and will give you friendly reminders to help keep you on track with your personally set health goals.
  This will help people stay on track and on top of their health goals which science has proven, makes you more likely to be satisfied with your life.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
  <h3>Software Challenges:</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Configuring a reliable communication protocol between the app and sensors</li>
    <li>Designing the database which will form the backend of our app</li>
    <li>Making the app look visualally appealing to users</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Hardware Challenges:</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Making the bracelet heart-rate monitor small enough to fit comfortably on the wrist and accurately measure the heart rate</li>
    <li>Figuring out battery/charging for the bracelet and straw</li>
    <li>Configuring the liquid sensor to accurately measure water intake</li>
  </ul>
<hr>
  
<h2>Proposed Methods</h2>
  <h3>Mitigating Software Challenges:</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Use bluetooth to communicate between the app and sensors. This has been proven to be reliable in past experiences</li>
    <li>We will choose a reliable database server (preferably cheap) and design the database structure around the entity-relationship model</li>
    <li>Two of our team members have mobile development experience and we will beta test the application design with users before release</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Hardware Challenges:</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>We know it has been done before and the components should be small enough to make it work</li>
    <li>We can either go the route of using solar power or we can make our bracelet and straw rechargable through a standard USB-C cable</li>
    <li>We have found a water sensor that we can use to measure the water depth and then create an embedded system to read and transmit this data</li>
  </ul>
